# Used-Vehicle-Product-Analysis
Using a Kaggle dataset, we conducted a used car sales analysis. The contributers: Arundhati,Rick,Nan,Kendall,Ohm,Jay.

Project Summary:

We developed a solution to help sellers accurately price used vehicles, addressing the common challenge of underpricing due to a lack of knowledge. Our project analyzed used car data from the US and UK, examining factors such as brand, model, transmission type, fuel type, year, mileage, and engine size. Using Python libraries, we cleaned and merged the data, explored market trends, and built a machine learning model to predict prices. The analysis highlighted features like transmission, year, and engine size as key determinants of price. Additionally, hybrid cars showed potential for growth due to rising consumer interest in sustainability. Our aim is to equip sellers with insights for informed pricing decisions and better negotiations, maximizing their profits in a growing used car market.
